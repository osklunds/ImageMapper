# ImageMapper

ImageMapper is a command line tool written in Rust for mapping a folder hierarchy of images to a new folder hierachy of images. The project is currently **work-in-progress**, but the goal is to make this an improved version of [my other similar project in Java](https://github.com/osklunds/ImageResizer).
